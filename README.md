example basic Ansible playbook, this playbook was deprecated, I'm strongly recommend that you don't use it anymore, I'll planning to update my old ansible playbook to meet current security best practices

- CentOS 7 (Deprecated)

## Todo / Upcoming Improvements
- [ ] Refactor scripts to follow shell scripting best practices
- [ ] Package scripts into RPM for easier distribution
- [ ] Add parameter support and improve documentation
